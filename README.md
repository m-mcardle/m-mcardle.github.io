# Welcome to my GitHub Pages!

I built my website using React.js and Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and component-driven web application.

## [Home Page](https://m-mcardle.github.io/#/)

On my home page you can read a little about me and what I'm interested in.

## [Magnet Forensics Co-op Page](https://m-mcardle.github.io/#/MagnetPage/)

On this page you can read my report on my first ever co-op term. 

I go over all the amazing experience I got and some of the cool technology I worked with during my 8 months there.

## [Tier List Page](https://m-mcardle.github.io/#/TierLists/F1)

On this page you can create some tier lists and compare to see how I rank F1 drivers, UFC fighters, and some fast food places. 

I built this to get some more experience with managing state in React and using the react-beautiful-dnd package which I first saw at Magnet. 

On this page you can save your list to export it to a JSON file that can be imported later.
